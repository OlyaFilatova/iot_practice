- Created Project
- Created code `study-grpc/project_1/python` and `study-grpc/project_1/protos/device_management.proto` based on unary RPC example from https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/
- Modified basic code to try raising exceptions.
- Code supports one method RegisterDevice, that receives device name and sends response with status=True and message of the successful device registration.
